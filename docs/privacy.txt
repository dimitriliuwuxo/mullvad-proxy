Privacy Policy
==============

Mullvad Proxy does not collect user data.

The extension makes API requests to servers operated by Mullvad VPN AB
for the purposes of providing a list of proxy servers, and to get
details about the current connection. Additionally, whilst connected to
a proxy server, all supported requests (including HTTP, HTTPS and FTP
requests) are made via that server.

The extension is not affiliated with Mullvad VPN AB. For information on
how user data collected by requests to their servers is handled, see
their privacy policy:
